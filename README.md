## üîß Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) installed and running locally
- [Docker](https://docker.com/) for running Qdrant vector database
- The `gemma3:4b-it-qat` and `snowflake-arctic-embed2:latest` models downloaded

### 1. Install Ollama
Follow the instructions at [ollama.com](https://ollama.com/) to install Ollama for your operating system.

### 2. Download Required Models
Once Ollama is installed, download both required models:
```bash
ollama pull gemma3:4b-it-qat
ollama pull snowflake-arctic-embed2:latest
```

### 3. Start Services

**Start Ollama:**
```bash
ollama serve
```

**Start Qdrant (in a separate terminal):**
```bash
docker run -p 6333:6333 qdrant/qdrant
```

### 4. Configure Environment

Copy the example environment file and configure for your setup:

```bash
# For development (localhost)
cp .env.example .env

# For production (edit with your actual host)
cp .env.example .env.production
```

For detailed environment configuration, see [ENV_SETUP.md](./ENV_SETUP.md).

### 5. Clone and Run the Application

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    bun install
    ```

3.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    bun run dev
    ```
    
    The application will now be running on a local port (e.g., `http://localhost:5173`).

### üê≥ Docker Production Deployment

For production deployment using Docker:

1.  **Build and run with Docker Compose:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose -p jotly up -d
    ```

2.  **Access the application:**
    - Jotly app: http://localhost:8099
    - Qdrant (if running locally): http://localhost:6333
    - Ollama (if running locally): http://localhost:11434

3.  **Stop services:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose -p jotly down
    ```

4.  **View logs:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose -p jotly logs -f
    ```

**Docker Setup Notes:**
- The app runs on port 8099 (configurable via docker-compose.yml)
- Uses nginx as reverse proxy for optimal performance
- Requires Ollama and Qdrant to be running separately (not in Docker)
- All configuration is handled via environment variables

## üí° How to Use
