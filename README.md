## ðŸ”§ Getting Started

To run this project locally, you'll need to have a Google Gemini API key.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```

2.  **Set up your API Key:**
    Create a file named `.env` in the root of the project and add your Google Gemini API key to it:
    ```
    API_KEY=your_google_gemini_api_key_here
    ```

3.  **Run the application:**
    Since this project uses a no-build setup with `importmap`, you can serve the files using any simple local web server. A common choice is `serve`:
    ```bash
    # If you don't have serve, install it globally
    npm install -g serve

    # Run the server
    serve .
    ```
    The application will now be running on a local port (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`).
